Hi and welcome to the personal blog of, me!

I&#8217;m Julian, the creator and resident nerdy dad behind this amazing/humble blog. As cliched as it sounds, I'm a lifelong learner. I love to build and I love to learn! For over 10 years I've played with all manner of Enterprise hardware and have more recently (4 years?) been obsessed with the Python Programming language. In fact, my best mate Bob and I have created a Python Blog - [PyBites](https://pybit.es) - as well as an entire online Python Coding Platform - [PyBites Code Challenges](https://codechalleng.es). More importantly, over the years, we've built up a Python Community filled with some of the most incredible people we've ever met.

Outside of PyBites though I'm also a Dad, Husband, dedicated family man, leader at AWS and avid reader.

I created this blog for the same reason most other people create blogs &#8211; too much to say with no one willing to listen! Just ask my friends, I could talk for days!

My aim is to use the blog to write about all of the things I have a passion for. At the moment, the three things in my crosshairs are:

  1. **Technology &#8211;** Given my love of Python, I.T and the fact that I work at one of the world&#8217;s largest cloud services companies, this is a given . I&#8217;m also a **massive** gamer (or used to be before kids, am I right?!). I actually attribute my entire career to gaming. If it wasn&#8217;t for Battlefield 1942, I&#8217;d have never gotten myself a job!
  2. **Money &#8211; **I happen to live in one of the most expensive cities in the country, if not the world: Sydney, Australia. I also have a family so having a healthy relationship with my finances is a must!
  3. **Kids &#8211;** My wife and I have two incredible boys. They&#8217;re both little ones and are the reason I get up in the morning. While they&#8217;ve definitely cramped by gaming style, I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing.

&nbsp;

You&#8217;re going to find lots of info based on my experiences with the above. Believe me, there&#8217;s a lot to talk about!

My other intention is to write reviews for all of the products I use and love. This may sound generic but it&#8217;s something I find lacking online these days, especially when it comes to the Australian market. When I go to buy something and search the internet for real user reviews I generally only see the negatives and even then, real information is scarce.

I want to provide proper, real world reviews, so stay tuned!
